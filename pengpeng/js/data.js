        contentCn: `面试官好。我叫秦雨芃，一个善于分析并拥有国际化沟通能力的市场营销学习者。

我的分析能力体现在北大的一个商业案例研究中。当时，我带领团队分析了淘米公司的商业模式，通过剖析其现金流和用户结构，我们精准地指出了公司过度依赖少数VIP玩家的盈利模式是不可持续的。基于这个分析，我们提出了优化用户分层和提升产品价值的策略，这个方案获得了教授的高度认可。这个经历让我第一次体会到数据驱动决策的魅力。

同时，我在中国国际商会的实习锻炼了我的国际沟通能力。我负责与来自不同国家和文化背景的政府代表、商会成员及企业高管沟通，确保"一带一路"企业家大会这样的大型国际活动顺利进行。这个经历让我学会了如何在跨文化环境中进行高效、精准的沟通，这对于全球化背景下的市场营销至关重要。

我的分析能力和国际沟通经验，与城大市场营销专业强调的"i-Marketing"理念——特别是其中的"Intelligence"（智能）和"International"（国际）——高度契合。我相信我已为在这里的深度学习做好了准备。`,
        contentEn: `Good morning, professors. My name is QIN Yupeng. I would describe myself as a marketing learner who is skilled in analysis and equipped with international communication capabilities.

My analytical skills were demonstrated in a business case study at Peking University. I led a team to analyze the business model of Taomee.com. By examining its cash flow and user structure, we accurately pointed out that its profit model, which heavily relied on a small number of VIP gamers, was unsustainable. Based on this analysis, we proposed strategies to optimize user segmentation and enhance product value, a proposal that was highly praised by our professor. This experience gave me my first taste of the power of data-driven decision-making.

Meanwhile, my internship at the China Chamber of International Commerce honed my international communication skills. I was responsible for communicating with government representatives, chamber members, and corporate executives from diverse cultural backgrounds to ensure the smooth running of major international events like the Belt and Road Entrepreneur Conference. This taught me how to communicate effectively and precisely in a cross-cultural setting, which is crucial for marketing in a global context.

My analytical skills and international communication experience align perfectly with the "i-Marketing" concept of CityU's marketing program, especially the "Intelligence" and "International" elements. I am confident that I am well-prepared for advanced study here.`

        contentCn: `我选择城大市场营销项目，是经过深入研究和慎重考虑的。这个过程始于我对市场营销知识的渴望，尤其是在全球化背景下如何制定有效的市场策略。

在探索中我发现，城大Marketing的课程设计非常吸引我。特别是市场分析（Marketing Analytics）这个细分方向，与我的职业目标——成为一名互联网科技公司的市场分析或用户增长专家——完美匹配。在浸会大学的学习中，我曾在一个课程项目中为淘宝进入香港市场制定营销策略。我分析了HKTVmall等本地竞争对手，并研究了香港消费者的行为习惯，提出了包括优化物流和本地化促销在内的一系列建议。这个过程让我深刻意识到，成功的全球营销不仅需要创意，更需要基于数据的精准洞察和对本地市场的深刻理解。

城大Marketing提供的课程，如数字营销、消费者行为分析等，正是我希望系统性提升的领域。同时，项目提供的商业领袖论坛和与ESSEC、台大等顶尖学府的合作项目，为我提供了接触行业前沿和拓展国际视野的宝贵机会。我相信，在这里的学习能为我实现职业目标提供最坚实的知识基础和最丰富的实践资源。`,
        contentEn: `I chose the CityU Marketing program after thorough research and careful consideration. This decision stemmed from my desire for marketing knowledge, especially on how to develop effective strategies in a globalized world.

During my research, I found the curriculum of CityU Marketing particularly appealing. The Marketing Analytics stream, in particular, perfectly matches my career goal of becoming a marketing analyst or user growth specialist in the tech industry. During my studies at HKBU, I worked on a project to develop a marketing strategy for Taobao's entry into the Hong Kong market. I analyzed local competitors like HKTVmall, researched local consumer behavior, and proposed a series of strategies including logistics optimization and localized promotions. This process made me realize that successful global marketing requires not just creativity, but also precise, data-based insights and a deep understanding of the local market.

The courses offered by CityU Marketing, such as digital marketing and consumer analytics, are exactly the areas I wish to build upon. Furthermore, the program's resources, like the Business Leaders Forum and joint degree programs with top universities like ESSEC and NTU, offer invaluable opportunities to connect with the industry and broaden my international perspective. I am confident that studying here will provide the solid foundation and rich resources I need to achieve my career goals.`

首先，我拥有扎实的学术能力。在副学士课程中，我取得了3.61的CGPA，这证明了我拥有快速学习和掌握商科知识的能力。我渴望将这种学习能力投入到更具挑战性的市场营销课程中。

其次，我具备卓越的领导才能。作为香港理工大学学生升旗队的第一届副主席，我从零开始，参与建立了50多人的团队和11人的执行委员会。我不仅负责招募和培训，还领导宣传团队，成功地在社交媒体上扩大了团队的影响力。这段经历证明了我具备组织、协调和领导团队达成目标的能力，我相信这在未来的团队项目中至关重要。

最后，我是一个有社会责任感的人。无论是为贫困儿童组织活动，还是为四川的小学生设计并教授课程，我都积极投身于志愿服务。这些经历让我学会了关爱社区，并致力于用自己的力量带来积极的改变。

综上所述，我不仅是一个成绩优秀的学生，更是一个有领导力、有温度的贡献者。我相信我的这些特质能为城大市场营销项目的学生社区带来独特的价值。`,
        contentEn: `You should offer me a place because I possess three key qualities essential for success in the CityU Marketing program: solid academic ability, proven leadership skills, and a strong sense of social responsibility.

First, I have a solid academic foundation. I achieved a CGPA of 3.61 in my Associate Degree program, which proves my ability to quickly learn and master business concepts. I am eager to apply this learning ability to the more challenging marketing courses here.

Second, I have proven leadership skills. As the founding Vice-Chairman of the Student Flag-Raising Team at PolyU, I helped build a 50-member team and an 11-member executive committee from scratch. I was involved in everything from recruitment and training to leading the publicity team, where we successfully expanded our team's influence on social media. This experience shows that I can organize, coordinate, and lead a team to achieve its goals, which I believe is vital for future team projects.

Finally, I have a strong sense of social responsibility. I have actively engaged in volunteer work, from organizing activities for underprivileged children to designing and teaching classes for primary school students in Sichuan. These experiences have taught me to care for the community and dedicate myself to making a positive impact.

In summary, I am not just a student with good grades; I am a leader and a contributor with a warm heart. I believe these qualities will allow me to bring unique value to the CityU Marketing student community.`

        titleEn: "What is your understanding of i-Marketing?",
        contentCn: `在我看来，i-Marketing代表了现代市场营销的三个核心支柱：互动（Interactive）、国际（International）和智能（Intelligence）。这不仅仅是一个理论框架，更是成为未来营销人才的行动指南。

Interactive（互动）：我认为这意味着与消费者建立双向的、有意义的连接，而不仅仅是单向的广告推送。例如，在运营舞蹈队的社交媒体时，我通过发布教程、举办线上活动等方式，与超过500名学生互动，最终获得了超过15,000的浏览量。这就是通过互动建立社群和品牌忠诚度的过程。

International（国际）：这要求我们具备全球视野和跨文化沟通的能力。我在中国国际商会的实习经历让我对此深有体会。在协助组织"一带一路"企业家大会时，我需要与来自完全不同文化和商业背景的国际代表沟通。这让我明白，一个成功的全球营销策略必须尊重并适应不同市场的文化差异。

Intelligence（智能）：这是指利用数据和技术进行智能决策。这正是我最感兴趣并希望深入学习的方向。在我对淘米公司的案例分析中，正是通过对财务数据和用户数据的"智能"分析，我们才发现了其商业模式的根本问题。我相信未来的营销竞争，核心就是数据智能的竞争。

因此，i-Marketing对我来说，是一个整合了"人际互动"、"全球视野"和"数据洞察"的先进理念，它将指导我成为一名全面的全球营销人才。`,
        contentEn: `In my view, i-Marketing represents the three core pillars of modern marketing: Interactive, International, and Intelligence. It's not just a theoretical framework, but a practical guide to becoming a future-ready marketing professional.

Interactive: To me, this means building a two-way, meaningful connection with consumers, rather than just one-way advertising. For example, when managing the social media for my dance team, I interacted with over 500 students by posting tutorials and hosting online events, which generated over 15,000 views. This is a real example of building a community and brand loyalty through interaction.

International: This requires a global mindset and cross-cultural communication skills. My internship at the China Chamber of International Commerce gave me a deep appreciation for this. While helping to organize the Belt and Road Entrepreneur Conference, I had to communicate with international representatives from very different cultural and business backgrounds. It taught me that a successful global marketing strategy must respect and adapt to cultural differences.

Intelligence: This refers to making smart decisions using data and technology. This is the area I am most passionate about and wish to study in depth. In my analysis of the Taomee case, it was through the "intelligent" analysis of financial and user data that we identified the fundamental problem in its business model. I believe the core of future marketing competition will be the competition of data intelligence.

Therefore, for me, i-Marketing is an advanced concept that integrates interpersonal interaction, a global perspective, and data-driven insights. It will guide me to become a well-rounded global marketing talent.`

短期目标（毕业后1-3年）：我希望能在一家科技公司，例如腾讯或字节跳动，担任市场分析师的职位。我希望能够运用在城大学到的数据分析技能，去设计用户行为追踪方案，分析数据以发现增长机会，并为产品和营销策略的优化提供数据支持。为了实现这个目标，在大学期间，我计划专注于Marketing Analytics方向的课程，并争取获得相关的实习机会，将理论知识应用到实践中。

长期目标（毕业后5-10年）：我希望能成长为一名能够领导跨职能团队的资深营销专家或团队负责人。我不仅希望自己能深入理解数据，更希望具备全球化的战略眼光，能够带领团队为品牌制定并执行进入新市场的完整策略。我相信，在城大建立的知识体系和国际视野，将是我实现这一长期目标的基石。`,

My short-term goal (1-3 years after graduation) is to work as a Marketing Analyst at a tech company, such as Tencent or ByteDance. I want to apply the data analysis skills learned at CityU to design user behavior tracking plans, analyze data to identify growth opportunities, and provide data support for product and marketing strategy optimization. To achieve this, I plan to focus on the Marketing Analytics stream and seek relevant internship opportunities during my studies to apply theory to practice.

My long-term goal (5-10 years after graduation) is to grow into a senior marketing expert or team leader who can lead cross-functional teams. I aspire to not only have a deep understanding of data but also a global strategic vision, enabling me to lead a team in developing and executing complete strategies for a brand to enter new markets.

最大的收获是，我通过《市场营销原理》、《经济学》和《财务会计》等核心课程，建立起了对商业世界运作的基本认知。这不仅是知识上的收获，更是思维方式的转变。我学会了如何用商业逻辑去分析问题，例如在市场营销课程中，我第一次接触到STP（市场细分、目标市场选择、市场定位）等分析工具，并立即将其应用到了解香港的电商市场中。这个过程让我确认了自己对市场营销的浓厚兴趣，并明确了未来希望深入学习的方向。可以说，副学士的学习为我申请城大的市场营销专业，打下了最重要、最坚实的基础。`,
        contentEn: `My Associate Degree experience was a successful transition and a solid foundation-building period for me. It transformed me from a student with only a preliminary interest in business into a learner with a systematic framework of business knowledge.

My biggest takeaway was building a fundamental understanding of how the business world operates through core courses like Principles of Marketing, Economics, and Financial Accounting. This was not just about gaining knowledge, but also about a shift in my way of thinking. I learned to analyze problems with business logic. For instance, in my marketing course, I was first introduced to analytical tools like STP—Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning—and immediately applied them to understand the e-commerce market in Hong Kong. This process confirmed my strong interest in marketing and clarified the direction I want to pursue. In short, my Associate Degree studies have laid the most important and solid foundation for my application to the CityU Marketing program.`

        contentCn: `对我触动最大的一门课是《市场营销原理》（Marketing Principles）。这门课最大的收获在于，它教会我如何将理论模型应用于解决真实的商业问题。

在课程的期末项目中，我的团队选择了为淘宝在香港市场的扩张制定营销策略。这不仅仅是一个纸上谈兵的作业。我们运用了课程中学到的SWOT分析法来评估淘宝的处境，用波特五力模型来分析香港电商市场的竞争格局。我们还进行了二手资料研究，去了解香港本地消费者对淘宝的看法，发现了他们在物流速度和售后服务上的"痛点"。

基于这些分析，我们提出了具体的、可执行的建议。这个过程让我第一次完整地经历了一个迷你版的营销策略制定周期：从市场调研、竞品分析，到发现问题、提出解决方案。这门课让我明白，市场营销是一门科学和艺术的结合，它让我从一个单纯的消费者，开始转变为一个懂得如何思考市场、理解消费者的"营销人"。`,
        contentEn: `The course that impacted me the most was "Principles of Marketing." Its greatest lesson was teaching me how to apply theoretical models to solve real business problems.

For our final project, my team chose to develop a marketing strategy for Taobao's expansion in Hong Kong. This was more than just an academic exercise. We used the SWOT analysis we learned in class to assess Taobao's situation and Porter's Five Forces model to analyze the competitive landscape of the Hong Kong e-commerce market. We also conducted secondary research to understand local consumer perceptions of Taobao and identified their "pain points" regarding logistics speed and after-sales service.

Based on this analysis, we proposed concrete and actionable recommendations. This process allowed me to experience a complete, mini-version of a marketing strategy cycle for the first time: from market research and competitor analysis to identifying problems and proposing solutions. This course made me understand that marketing is a combination of science and art. It transformed me from a simple consumer into a "marketing person" who knows how to think about the market and understand consumers.`

        title: "销售与市场营销的区别是什么？",
        titleEn: "What is the difference between sales and marketing?",
        contentCn: `我认为，市场营销（Marketing）和销售（Sales）是两个紧密相关但角色不同的职能。一个简单的比喻是：市场营销负责"让顾客想来"，而销售负责"让顾客买单"。

从战略层面看，市场营销更宏观，它是一个系统的过程，包括市场研究、产品定位、品牌建设、价格策略和渠道管理等。它的核心目标是理解消费者需求，并创造出相应的价值和品牌吸引力，从而产生潜在客户。它是在为产品"铺路"。

而销售更具体，它处在与顾客互动的第一线。它的核心目标是将市场营销活动吸引来的潜在客户，转化为真正的购买者。它更注重短期的销售目标、客户关系维护和成交技巧。它是"临门一脚"。

总而言之，市场营销是拉力（Pull），创造一个让顾客主动走近的品牌环境；销售是推力（Push），在顾客走近后，推动他们完成最终的购买决策。两者缺一不可，共同驱动着企业的增长。`,
        contentEn: `I believe marketing and sales are two closely related but distinct functions. A simple analogy would be: marketing is responsible for making customers want to come, while sales is responsible for making them buy.

From a strategic perspective, marketing is more macro. It's a systematic process that includes market research, product positioning, brand building, pricing strategy, and channel management. Its core goal is to understand consumer needs and create corresponding value and brand appeal to generate leads. It's about "paving the road" for the product.

Sales, on the other hand, is more specific and operates on the front line of customer interaction. Its core goal is to convert the potential customers attracted by marketing efforts into actual buyers. It focuses more on short-term sales targets, customer relationship management, and closing techniques. It's the "final push."

In conclusion, marketing is a "pull" strategy, creating a brand environment that attracts customers. Sales is a "push" strategy, prompting customers to make the final purchase decision after they've been attracted. Both are indispensable and work together to drive a company's growth.`

        contentCn: `我最欣赏的公司之一是小米。因为它不仅仅是在销售产品，更是在构建一个以用户为核心的生态系统，这完美地诠释了"互动式营销"的理念。

首先，小米的用户参与感做得非常出色。从MIUI操作系统开始，小米就鼓励用户在论坛上提出建议和反馈，并快速迭代到产品中。用户不再是单纯的消费者，而是品牌的共建者。这种高度的互动性，建立起了极强的品牌忠诚度和社群文化，也就是所谓的"米粉文化"。

其次，小米的生态链战略是一个非常高明的市场营销策略。它通过投资一系列生活方式类的公司，将手机这个核心产品，延伸到了智能手环、空气净化器、电视等几乎所有生活场景。这不仅增加了用户的购买频次和客单价，更重要的是，它将"小米"这个品牌与"智能、便捷、高性价比的生活方式"深度绑定。

从小米的成功中我看到，未来的市场营销，关键在于如何与用户深度互动，并为他们提供超越单一产品的整合价值。这也是我希望在城大深入学习和研究的方向。`,
        contentEn: `One of the companies I admire the most is Xiaomi. This is because it doesn't just sell products; it builds a user-centric ecosystem, which perfectly illustrates the concept of "interactive marketing."

First, Xiaomi excels at creating a sense of user participation. Starting with its MIUI operating system, Xiaomi has always encouraged users to provide suggestions and feedback on its forums, which are then quickly integrated into product updates. Users are not just consumers; they are co-creators of the brand. This high level of interaction has built extremely strong brand loyalty and a community culture, known as the "Mi Fan" culture.

Second, Xiaomi's ecosystem strategy is a very clever marketing approach. By investing in a range of lifestyle companies, it extends its core product, the smartphone, into almost every aspect of life, including smart bands, air purifiers, and TVs. This not only increases user purchase frequency and value but, more importantly, it deeply associates the "Xiaomi" brand with a "smart, convenient, and cost-effective lifestyle."

From Xiaomi's success, I see that the key to future marketing is how to interact deeply with users and provide them with integrated value that goes beyond a single product. This is also a direction I hope to study and research in depth at CityU.`

        titleEn: "What do you think of AI Marketing?",
        contentCn: `我认为AI营销是一把双刃剑，它为营销人员和消费者都带来了革命性的变化，同时也伴随着新的挑战。

对于营销人员来说，AI是前所未有的强大工具。

机遇：首先，AI极大地提升了效率。例如，它可以自动分析海量用户数据，实现千人千面的个性化推荐，或者用AIGC快速生成广告文案和图片。其次，它让预测性分析成为可能，帮助营销人员更精准地预测市场趋势和用户行为。

挑战：挑战在于，营销人员需要具备新的技能，即"与AI协作"的能力。他们需要学会如何提出正确的问题，如何解读AI的分析结果，并对AI的决策进行监督和优化，而不是被动地接受。

对于消费者来说，AI也带来了复杂的体验。

好处：消费者可以获得更个性化、更相关的信息和服务。例如，我们能更快地找到自己喜欢的商品，享受到更贴心的客户服务。

担忧：担忧主要来自隐私和信息茧房。消费者会担心自己的数据被如何使用，是否安全。同时，过度个性化的推荐，也可能让我们陷入"信息茧房"，视野变得越来越窄，难以接触到新的、不一样的信息。

总的来说，我认为拥抱AI是必然趋势。关键在于如何建立一个透明、合乎道德的框架，让技术在提升效率和体验的同时，也能保障消费者的权益和选择权。`,
        contentEn: `I see AI marketing as a double-edged sword. It brings revolutionary changes for both marketers and consumers, but it also comes with new challenges.

For marketers, AI is an incredibly powerful tool.

The opportunity: First, AI greatly improves efficiency. For example, it can automatically analyze massive amounts of user data to deliver personalized recommendations or use AIGC to quickly generate ad copy and images. Second, it enables predictive analytics, helping marketers to forecast market trends and user behavior more accurately.

The challenge: The challenge is that marketers need to develop new skills, specifically the ability to "collaborate with AI." They need to learn how to ask the right questions, interpret AI's analysis, and supervise and optimize its decisions, rather than passively accepting them.

For consumers, AI also brings a mixed experience.

The benefit: Consumers can receive more personalized and relevant information and services. For example, we can find products we like more quickly and enjoy more attentive customer service.

The concern: The concerns are mainly about privacy and "echo chambers." Consumers worry about how their data is being used and whether it is secure. Also, overly personalized recommendations might trap us in an "information echo chamber," narrowing our perspectives and preventing us from discovering new and different information.

Overall, I believe embracing AI is the inevitable trend. The key is to establish a transparent and ethical framework that allows technology to improve efficiency and experience while also protecting consumer rights and choices.`

基于这个出色的平台，我一直在思考，如果将我们项目核心的'i-Marketing'理念融入其中，是否能让它变得更加有影响力。我有一些想法：

可以更Interactive（互动性）：在活动前通过问卷收集学生最关心的问题，让嘉宾可以针对性地回答；活动中，可以引入实时投票或留言板，让所有同学都能参与讨论；活动后，可以组织小型的Workshop，让学生有机会在嘉宾指导下，就某个具体问题进行深入探讨。

可以更International（国际化）：除了香港本地的商业领袖，可以邀请更多元的嘉宾，比如通过线上方式，邀请一些在东南亚或欧美市场取得成功的企业家，分享他们在不同文化环境下的实战经验。

可以更Intelligent（智能化）：我们可以利用数据分析往期活动的参与度和反馈，来"智能"地判断哪些行业和话题是学生最感兴趣的，从而更精准地规划未来的主题。同时，可以为每次活动创建一个专属的线上资料库，让学习的效果得以延续。

通过这些结合了'i-Marketing'理念的改进，我相信商业领袖论坛可以从一个单向的知识传递活动，升级为一个互动的、国际化的、智能驱动的学习社区，为学生带来更大的价值。`,
        contentEn: `First of all, I must say that the Business Leaders Forum is one of the most attractive aspects of the CityU Marketing program for me. The opportunity to hear directly from top industry leaders is the most valuable bridge connecting the classroom to the real business world for students. The platform itself is already excellent.

Building on this excellent platform, I've been thinking about how we could make it even more impactful by integrating our program's core 'i-Marketing' concept. I have a few ideas:

Make it more Interactive: Before the event, we could collect students' most pressing questions through a survey so speakers can address them specifically. During the event, we could use live polls or message boards to allow all students to participate in the discussion. After the event, we could organize small workshops where students can have in-depth discussions on a specific topic under the guidance of the speaker.

Make it more International: In addition to local Hong Kong business leaders, we could invite a more diverse range of speakers. For example, we could virtually invite entrepreneurs who have succeeded in Southeast Asian or Western markets to share their practical experiences in different cultural contexts.

Make it more Intelligent: We could use data to analyze the attendance and feedback from past events to "intelligently" determine which industries and topics are most interesting to students, allowing for more precise planning of future themes. Also, we could create a dedicated online resource library for each event, ensuring that the learning effect is sustained.

By implementing these improvements based on the 'i-Marketing' concept, I believe the Business Leaders Forum could be upgraded from a one-way knowledge transfer event into an interactive, international, and intelligently-driven learning community, bringing even greater value to students.`
